##Abstract
With ever increasing development costs due to the adoption of new hardware platforms and the expectations they create among the game buying public, there is a pressing need to automate as much of a title’s production process as possible. While procedural content creation techniques are increasingly seen as an answer to the trend and are consequently gaining widespread diffusion, they are limited in their applications by their general inability to establish emotional connections with the user.

The current body of work attempts to improve procedural content creation techniques’ ability to emotionally target the user by relying on musical tracks selected by him as inputs, in turn broadening their range of possible usages.

Research was carried out into defining a small set of numerically expressible parameters synthesizing key audio perceptual features as well as into implementing a method for their computation from digitized representations of audio signals. Subsequently, a proof of concept background music reactive application was created to show the feasibility of their usage as seed for procedural content creation.

By providing a method for audio perceptual feature calculation and proving its applicability to game scenarios, the development of new procedural content creation techniques that can be used in more prominent ways is facilitated.

##System Requirements
Windows XP or later with the latest version of the DirectX 9 runtime installed, a reasonably recent CPU (Intel Core 1.6 GHz or better), at least 1GB RAM (2 GB recommended for longer tracks), audio output devices.
